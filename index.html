	<p>
		This is a fork of <a href="sapplyvalues.github.io">SapplyValues</a> to change some things.<br>
		This is a work in progress, so it might feel skewed. It's not done yet, and even then I may occasionally make changes.<br>
		Some questions have been further reworded or even changed/removed outright.<br>
		The goal is to provide relief from libertarian biases (such as with the gotcha questions) and other biases that are present in the original tests.<br>
		It is also to make sure that "culture-war" questions are removed for a better reading.<br>
		No more prog/cons; it is now dem/rep. In this test, dem (democratic) means how much control you believe the people should have over membership of the state. The more rep-leaning (republican-leaning) you are, the more you believe that membership of the state should be controlled by itself rather than the people.<br>
		Dem is completely seperate from auth in this test, and auth just determines to what degree you believe the state should exist and have control (it does NOT mean "Nazi Germany authoritarianism").<br>
		I plan to also add another compass thingy that is somewhat like prog/cons but focused on queer rights, which I heavily support but unfortunately some people don't agree.<br>
		Most 15-year-old girls have no idea what they are talking about, and I don't believe that I'm the exception, so if you believe that I've got something wrong in this test then please, by all means, let me know: <a href="mailto:me@akiragirl.dev">me@akiragirl.dev</a>

	<h2>What is SapplyValues?</h2>
	<p>
		SapplyValues is a political compass test that combines the questions of the <a href="http://sapplypoliticalcompass.com/">Sapply test</a>* with the UI of <a href="https://8values.github.io/">8values</a>. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be displayed on a political compass.<br /><br />
		* A few questions have been reworded as I feel some of them were poorly written.</br></br>
		There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.
	</p>
	<h2>Why use this version?</h2>
	<p>
		Both the original and the popular clone version have a number of issues and are very poorly coded. For starters, many users run into NaN errors. This happens when using the keyboard to press enter to go to the next page instead of clicking it. This doesn't apply at all to this version.</br></br>
		Secondly, the original version does not properly generate an image. It puts an overlay on top of a CSS-defined background image, meaning that if you save the image, it just saves the overlay instead of the whole compass. This is fixed in this version.</br></br>
		Thirdly, this version supports URL parameters, meaning you can easily share the link to your results and if you lose the image, you can find the results page entry with parameters in your history so you don't have to retake the whole test.</br></br>
		Finally, the 8values / 9Axes UI is far better (in my opinion anyway). It looks nicer and takes less clicks to answer.
	</p>
	<h2>Your questions / results suck!</h2>
	<p>You will have to complain to the original Sapply creator. I did not make this test, I simply changed the UI.</p>
	<h2>Privacy notice</h2>
	<p>This site uses Google Analytics. As well at the end of the test, you will be given the option to fill out general demographic information about yourself. There will be 3 options. The first will take you to a small survey and will record your answers to that along with the results. The second will just record your results. The third will not record anything. All information recorded is totally anonymous.</p>
